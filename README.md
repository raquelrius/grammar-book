In order to have your local mongodb, execute the command ```docker-compose up``` on the directory /db. Or if you want to access to the mongodb console, execute the file ```./open-db-console.sh```

In order to start the server use ```npm start``` on the directory /server

In order to create test data on the mongodb, use the command ```node create-test-data.js``` on the directory /src
